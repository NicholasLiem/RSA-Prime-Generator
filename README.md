# RSA-Prime-Generator
The main idea of this algorithm is to generate a specified list of prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, then a large random number will be generated. This number goes through the first phase of the prime test, that is, we check whether this number is divisible by the list of prime numbers, if it is not divisible by any of the prime numbers then this number will go through the second stage of the prime test. The second stage of the prime test is the primality test using the Miller-Rabin algorithm, if a number passes these two tests we say that the number is a number that is very likely to be prime.
